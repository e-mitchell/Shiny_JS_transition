# Shiny_JS_transition
An example to re-create a Shiny app using raw HTML and Javascript

The [shiny](shiny) folder contains R code (app.R) and R data (MEPS_data.Rdata). To run the app, open app.R in R or RStudio, select the entire code, and click 'Run' or 'Run App' (RStudio)

The [webpage](webpage) folder contains an HTML file (index.html) and JSON data (MEPS_data.json) that mimics the Shiny app. To view the webpage, open the index.html file in a web browser.

The data is from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), 2013-2016. For more information on MEPS, see [https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/)
